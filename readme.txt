This plugin allows users to embed queries created using Wikidata Query Service using WordPress native embed feature.

== Description ==
This plugin allows users to embed queries created using [Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org) using WordPress native embed feature. This is particulary
useful if you are blogging about any kind of data, and you wish to use Wikidata Query Service at your blog. This means you can avoid using the raw HTML block
(which can be dangerous), and just use the embed block.

To use this plugin, just embed any query you created at Wikidata Query Service. The URL used for the embed block should be the one you see, ie. not the from the
embeding iframe that's generated by Wikidata Query Service.
